## Singly Linked List

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, contains a data part and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The list starts with a head node and ends with a node whose next pointer is null, indicating the end of the list.

### Problems Solved by Singly Linked List

**Dynamic Size:**
Singly linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically, allowing for efficient use of memory without the need for pre-allocating a fixed size.

**Efficient Insertions and Deletions:**
Insertion and deletion of elements are efficient, especially when the position is known. These operations can be performed in O(1) time by adjusting pointers, unlike arrays that may require shifting elements.

**Memory Utilization:**
Singly linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation. Each node is stored separately and linked using pointers, making it easier to manage memory, especially when dealing with fragmented memory.

**Flexibility in Data Management:**
They provide better flexibility when the data size is not known in advance or when frequent insertions and deletions are required. This flexibility is useful in implementing dynamic data structures like stacks and queues.

**Avoiding Overhead of Array Resizing:**
When using arrays, resizing them to accommodate more elements can be costly (O(n) time complexity). Singly linked lists avoid this overhead by allowing elements to be added or removed without resizing.
