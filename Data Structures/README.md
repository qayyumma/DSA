## 1. Data Structures
- **Arrays and Strings**: Operations, common problems (like subarrays, subsequences, etc.).
- **Linked Lists**: Single, doubly, circular linked lists, operations (insertion, deletion, reversal, etc.).
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation, applications (like expression evaluation, BFS, etc.).
- **Hashing**: Hash tables, hash maps, collision resolution techniques.

## 2. Trees
- **Binary Trees**: Traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order), operations.
- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**: Insertion, deletion, searching, balancing.
- **Heaps**: Min-heap, max-heap, priority queue.
- **Advanced Trees**: AVL trees, Red-Black trees, Segment trees, Fenwick trees.

## 3. Graphs
- **Graph Representation**: Adjacency matrix, adjacency list.
- **Traversal Algorithms**: Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS).
- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.
- **Advanced Topics**: Topological sorting, strongly connected components.
