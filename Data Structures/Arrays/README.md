Arrays are a fundamental data structure in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). They store elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory, making them very efficient for random access and certain types of operations. Hereâ€™s an overview of arrays in Java within the context of DSA:

### 1. Declaration and Initialization
In Java, arrays can be declared and initialized in several ways:

**Declaration:**
```
int[] arr;      // preferred way
int arr[];      // also valid
```

**itialization:**
```
arr = new int[5];                   // creates an array of size 5
int[] arr = new int[5];             // declaration and initialization
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

```
