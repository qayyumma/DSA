## Tree Traversal Techniques

Tree Traversal techniques include various ways to visit all the nodes of the tree. Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways. In this article, we will discuss about all the tree traversal techniques along with their uses.

### Tree Traversal Techniques:

![Time Complexity](images/Tree-Traversal-Techniques.webp)

A Tree Data Structure can be traversed in following ways:

- Depth First Search or DFS
  - Inorder Traversal
  - Preorder Traversal
  - Postorder Traversal

- Level Order Traversal or Breadth First Search or BFS

**Inorder Traversal :**

![Time Complexity](images/Preorder-Traversal-of-Binary-Tree.webp)

Inorder traversal visits the node in the order: Left -> Root -> Right

Algorithm for Inorder Traversal:

Inorder(tree)

Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Inorder(left->subtree)

Visit the root.

Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Inorder(right->subtree)

**Uses of Inorder Traversal:**

In the case of binary search trees (BST), Inorder traversal gives nodes in non-decreasing order.

To get nodes of BST in non-increasing order, a variation of Inorder traversal where Inorder traversal is reversed can be used.

Inorder traversal can be used to evaluate arithmetic expressions stored in expression trees.

```
void printInorder(Node node)
{
    if (node == null)
        return;

    // First recur on left child
    printInorder(node.left);

    // Then print the data of node
    System.out.print(node.key + " ");

    // Now recur on right child
    printInorder(node.right);
}
```


**Output**
Inorder traversal of binary tree is

**Time Complexity:** O(N)

**Auxiliary Space:** If we donâ€™t consider the size of the stack for function calls then O(1) otherwise O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
