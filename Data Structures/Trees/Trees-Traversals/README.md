## Tree Traversal Techniques

Tree Traversal techniques include various ways to visit all the nodes of the tree. Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways. In this article, we will discuss about all the tree traversal techniques along with their uses.

A Tree Data Structure can be traversed in following ways:

- Depth First Search or DFS
  - Inorder Traversal
  - Preorder Traversal
  - Postorder Traversal

- Level Order Traversal or Breadth First Search or BFS
