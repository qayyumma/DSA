## Tree Traversal Techniques

Tree Traversal techniques include various ways to visit all the nodes of the tree. Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways. In this article, we will discuss about all the tree traversal techniques along with their uses.
